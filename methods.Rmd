### Overview 

This document describes the methods used to delineate plausible values of the intrinsic transmissibility and immune evasion of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. It is structured in three parts:
 - A summary of Bayesian implementation of the model of vaccine efficacy
 - The extension of this Bayesian model to available data on Omicron
 - Details on model fitting by MCMC using the greta R package

### Vaccine efficacy model

The core of this analysis is a Bayesian implementation of a predictive model of vaccine efficacy documented and validated in [Khoury et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01377-8) and [Cromer et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00267-6). The original publications estimate parameters by maximum likelihood, and focus on predicting vaccine efficacies for different combinations of vaccine dose and product, the outcome against which efficacy is measured, and the SARS-CoV-2 variant, based on neutralising antibody titres. See those publications for detailed analysis and validation.

This model assumes that each immune individual $i$ in a population has some neutralisation level$n_{i,v}$ to variant $v$, given by the common (ie. base 10) logarithm of the titre of neutralising antibody, relative to the mean neutralisation level produced by infection with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. This indexing on wild-type convalescent neutralisation levels enables comparability between studies and across variants. The individual's neutralisation level is assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution with mean $\mu_{s,d,v}$ differing based on the source of their immunity $s$ (e.g. the vaccine dose or product), the number of days $d$ post-peak immunity (ie. the degree of waning) adnd the variant, and with variance $\sigma^2$ giving the inter-individual variation in neutralisation levels - assumed to be constant across variants, sources of immunity, and levels of waning:

$n_{i,v} \sim N(\mu_{s,d,v}, \sigma^2)$
    
For each individual and for each type of outcome $o$ (e.g. death, severe disease, infection, onward transmission) the probability that the outcome is averted $E_{i,o}$ (the vaccine is effective for that outcome) is given by a sigmoid function, parameterised by a threshold neutralisation level $n_{o,50}$ at which 50% of outcome events are prevented, and a slope parameter $k$ determining the steepness of this relationship. Crucially, these parameters are assumed to independent of the variant and source of immunity, enabling prediction of vaccine efficacy to new situations.

$E_{o}(n_{i,v}) = 1 / (1 + e^{-k(n_{i,v} - n_{o,50})})$

Note that this model can equivalently be interpreted as there being a different deterministic threshold for each different *event* whereby that outcome would occur in the absence of vaccination, and would not occur if the neutralisation level is above the random threshold, where the random thresholds are drawn from a logistic distribution with location parameter $n_{o,50}$ and scale parameter $1/k$.

At the population level, the efficacy of immunity against a given outcome from a given variant in a cohort with mean neutralisation level $\mu_{s,d,v}$ is the average probability over the whole population of the outcome being averted. This is computed by integrating the sigmoid function with respect to the normal distribution of neutralisation levels. This integral has no closed form, so must be computed by numerical approximation (Gauss-Legendre quadrature).

$P_{s,d,o,v} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} E_{o}(n_v)f(n_v | \mu_{s,d,v}, \sigma^2) dn_v$

The mean neutralisation level $\mu_{s,d,v}$ for a cohort with immunity source $s$ and number of days $d$ since peak immunity from that source is assumed to follow exponential decay with half-life of $h$ days, from a peak mean neutralisation level against that variant of $\mu^*_{s,v}$ for each source:

$\mu_{s,d} = log10(10 ^ {\mu^*_{s,v}} e^{-d/h})$

The peak mean neutralisation level against a given variant is in turn modelled as a log10 fold increase or decrease in neutralising antibody titres that variant, relative to an index variant:

$\mu^*_{s,v} = \mu^*_{s,0} + F_v$

Where for the index variant $F_v = 0$, for a variant with immune escape relative to the index the $F_v < 1$, and for a variant more susceptible  to neutralisation than the index, $F_v > 1$.

Among these model parameters, $\mu^*_{s,0}$, $F_v$, $h$, $\sigma^2$ can be estimated from neutralisation assay experiments. The parameters $n_{o,50}$ (one per outcome) and $k$ (one in total) must be learned by fitting the model to data on population-level vaccine efficacy. In this Bayesian implementation, the parameter $\sigma^2$ is kept fixed at the value estimated by [Cromer et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00267-6), $\mu^*_{s,0}$, $F_v$, and $h$ are given informative priors based on estimates from [Khoury et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01377-8) and [Cromer et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00267-6), and the remaining parameters are given less  informative priors. This enables the model to update these parameters slightly based on the data, and fully incorporate uncertainty in these parameters into predictions.

This model is fitted to estimates from [Andrews et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.15.21263583) of the population-level efficacy of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines (two doses) against clinical outcomes (death, severe disease, symptomatic infection) from the Delta variant over different periods of time post-administration, and estimates from [Pouwels et al. (2021)](ttps://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264260) and from [Eyre et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264260) against acquisition (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and onward transmission of breakthrough infections, respectively, of the Delta variant.

The model likelihood for vaccine efficacy estimate $j$ is defined as a normal distribution over the logit-transformed estimate $\text{VE}_j$, with mean given by the logit-transformed predicted efficacy for that combination of source, days post-administration, outcome, and variant $P_{s_j,d_j,o_j,v_j}$ and with variance given by the sum of the square of the standard error of the estimate on the logit scale $\text{logit-SE}^2_{j}$ (approximated from provided uncertainty intervals), and an additional variance term $\sigma^2_{\text{ve}}$, to represent any additional errors in these estimates that may arise from inference on observational data:

$\text{logit}(\text{VE}_j) \sim N(\text{logit}(P_{s_j,d_j,o_j,v_j}), \text{logit-SE}^2_{j} + \sigma^2_{\text{ve}})$

All VE estimates covered events over a period of time, and $d_j$ was taken as the midpoint of that period.

### Extension to Omicron



### Fitting the model

The model is defined, fitted, and predicted from using the greta R package. Inference is performed with 10 independent chains of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, each run for 1000 samples after 1000 (discarded) warmup iterations. Convergence is assessed by the potential scale reduction factor statistic (1.01 or less for all parameters), the effective sample size (greater than 500 for all parameters) and visual inspection of trace plots.

For choices of prior distributions, see [here](R/build_neut_model.R) for the main vaccine efficacy model and [here](R/add_omicron_model.R) for extensions to inferring the transmissibility and immune escape of Omicron. See [here](R/analysis) for more details of model fitting, and an overview of the entire analysis.
